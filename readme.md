# 3 Item Todo List
Ever try using a Todo List (of course you have) where you just have too many items to take care of?

Sometimes, having too many tasks can overwhelm us, and can be counterproductive to actually - y'know - getting stuff done.

That's why I've decided to create the 3 Item Todo List. The basic idea comes from the [Five Minute Journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal), another great productivity journal that narrows down the number of items you can jot down at three.

Why three? Because it forces you to prioritize your schedule, and only list the items that are truly important, rather than items that can be deferred until a later time. 

Imagine this: if you got the three most important things to you right now done today, would you feel like today was a success? Chances are, if you're like me, getting these three things done would qualify as a successful day. You'd be getting 80% of the work done with only three tasks.

Now of course, you might have more than three things you want to get done in a day, and that's perfectly fine. I plan to add an additional section which will allow you to list other todo items as well.

But I really want you to focus on the main three before moving onto anything else, okay? Cool.

In the future, I want to implement charts which will track your performance from day to day, and also have weekly summaries, which are kind of like reports of all the tasks you completed in the past week. I think this will be incredibly helpful to look back on as you progress on your journey, and to see how far you've come.
